Risk AI - Java
======

School Projet developed for Ecole Polytechnique Montreal's class INF4215 - Artificial Intelligence

Intelligence Artificial project based on the populare RISK board game.  This is a basic implementation of
the classic game, with a very simple UI.  The goal of this project was to implement an intelligent agent,
capable of winning a RISK game.  

Every student (5) were tasked to develop their AI in secret so we could host a final competition, 
pitting those 5 different agents against each other, and determine a winner.
